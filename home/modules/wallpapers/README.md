# Wallpapers

This directory is used by `home/modules/catppuccin.nix`:

- It is copied to `~/.config/wallpapers` via `home.file.".config/wallpapers".source = ./wallpapers;`.
- You can place your wallpaper images here (e.g. `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`).

Suggested usage:

- Put your preferred wallpapers into this folder and commit them if you want them tracked.
- Or keep it empty and use it only as a placeholder; the system will still work.
